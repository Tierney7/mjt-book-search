# Book Search

## Description
Take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. Starter code was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
I set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
Modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
Created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
Application was deployed using Heroku

## Installation 
npm i 
npm install @apollo/server graphql
